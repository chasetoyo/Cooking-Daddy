### About
Cooking Daddy is a portrait orientated game where the player must catch falling ingredients in a basket. It will be a 2D game, with movement in only the X axis. The dish will appear at the top of the screen with the listed ingredients, and then ingredients will start falling from the top of the screen. The player loses stars (start with 5 stars) if they get ingredients that arenâ€™t listed or if they get more than the listed amount of one ingredient. The player wins if they can match the ingredient list. If they win, they will be rewarded with a picture of their finished dish and move on to the next level.
